# Changelog

All notable changes to OS AI Computer Use will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.2] - 2025-10-26

### Fixed

#### Production Build Issues
- **Fixed Flutter app not launching in production build**
  - Updated `launcher.py` to search for correct Flutter app name: `OS AI.app` instead of `frontend_flutter.app`
  - Updated `packaging/launcher-macos.spec` to bundle Flutter app using `Tree()` method
  - This preserves the `.app` bundle structure and prevents PyInstaller from processing executables as binaries
  - Affects both production (PyInstaller bundle) and development modes
  - Files: `launcher.py:86-104`, `packaging/launcher-macos.spec:16-85`

#### Impact
- Production builds (`dist/OS AI.app`) now launch successfully
- Both backend and Flutter frontend start correctly
- System tray integration works as expected

### Known Limitations

1. **Web Platform Security** - Uses localStorage instead of native keychain (less secure)
2. **Single Key per Provider** - Only one Anthropic key and one OpenAI key supported
3. **No Auto-Rotation** - Users must manually update expired keys
4. **No Biometric Auth** - Direct API key access without additional authentication

---

### Breaking Changes

None - This is the first major release.

---

### Migration Guide

#### From CLI-only Usage

If you were using the CLI (`python main.py --task "..."`):
1. The CLI still works with environment variables (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
2. For GUI, API keys are now stored in system keychain
3. First launch will prompt you to enter API key
4. Old `.env` files still work as fallback

---

### Upgrade Instructions

#### First Time Install
1. Download release for your platform
2. Run the application
3. Enter API key in welcome dialog
4. Start using!

#### Upgrading from Pre-1.0
1. Your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable will continue to work
2. For GUI storage, enter key in Settings screen
3. No data migration needed
