OS base package
================

This package provides OS-agnostic ports (Mouse, Keyboard, Screen, Overlay, Sound, Permissions), a PlatformDrivers container, and a factory to load platform-specific drivers via entry points. Use os_ai_os.api.get_drivers() to access the current platform implementation.
